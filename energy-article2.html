      <h1>AI and EVs Are Supercharging Power Demand—Next-Gen Nuclear Stands Ready to Deliver</h1>

      <h2 class="animate slide-left">The rapid advancement of AI, electrification of transport, and proliferation of data centers are reshaping global electricity demand forecasts</h2>
      <p class="animate slide-left">
        Data centers powering AI models, large-scale machine learning operations, and cloud computing are some of the most energy-intensive facilities today. Projections show that global power demand from data centers alone could increase by over 160% by 2030, driven largely by AI-related workloads. In the United States, this means data centers could consume as much as 8% of the nation’s total power supply by the end of the decade.
      </p>

      <p class="animate slide-left">
        At the same time, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is further accelerating power demand. With millions of EVs expected to hit the roads in the next several years, the pressure on the grid is growing. Charging infrastructure, particularly fast-charging stations, introduces new peak loads at times and locations that traditional power systems weren’t designed to handle. While renewables like wind and solar are scaling up, their variable output underscores the urgent need for stable, on-demand energy solutions.
      </p>

      <p class="animate slide-left">
        Next-generation nuclear, especially SMRs, offers precisely the type of consistent, carbon-free power these emerging technologies require. SMRs can provide the 24/7, high-reliability electricity needed to support data centers, AI operations, and EV charging networks. Their modularity allows them to be sited close to demand centers, reducing transmission constraints and maximizing efficiency. In this rapidly shifting energy landscape, nuclear stands ready to partner with the technologies that are shaping our future.
